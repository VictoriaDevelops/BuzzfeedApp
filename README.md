# Quiz Website
This website is a Buzzfeed-style quiz application designed to provide users with unique quizzes that generate personalized recommendations. The key features include five engaging quizzes, covering topics such as cafes, Dungeons and Dragons classes, music, books, and travel destinations. Our application addresses the common challenge of users struggling to find tailored recommendations by offering fun, interactive quizzes to guide their choices. This project was developed as part of WiC's Fall 2024 project teams initiative. The primary goal was to create a Buzzfeed-inspired quiz app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
